POAF Notes

Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a persistent and serious surgical complication that occur in 20-55% of cardiac surgery cases. Patients have a 2-fold increase in mortality risk and spend about 3.7 more days in the hospital and $16,000 more in medical costs during their visit. 

Patients have a 2-fold increase in mortality risk and spend about 3.7 more days in the hospital and $16,000 more in medical costs during their visit. 

Current mechanisms that are postulated to contribute to POAF include an increase in sympathetic tone, oxidative stress, local and systemic inflammation, a trigger that induces atrial substrate changes, a driver to sustain POAF, and electrolyte disturbances such as hypomagnesemia.

current risk factors include age, male sex, history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and COPD.

Treatments mostly include prophylaxis of repurposed drugs such as beta-blockers, statins, oral anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and Vitamin D and electrolyte supplementation. Autonomic denervation has also been a promising preventative measure for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib.4

In about 90% of patients who develop POAF it occurs within the first six days post operation, corresponding with the peak of the postoperative systemic inflammation response

Post-operative atrial fibrillation typically presents differently from other forms of AF. POAF typically develops within the first 6 days post-operation and then returns to normal sinus rhythm. 

POAF usually require a trigger and a vulnerable atrial substrate change, typically originating from the pulmonary veins and other atrial locations

If POAF is caused by local or systemic inflammation, why do drugs that decrease the levels and activity of inflammatory markers lead to a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation?

Pain, especially unrelieved pain, could be a trigger for atrial fibrillation. 

findings from this study suggest no association between opioid use and atrial fibrillation and delirium.

In a recent study 43% of patients developed POAF and showed increased post-operative fluid balance and M-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP). Also, anemia pre-operation led to increased transfusion volumes, and suggests that POAF may be triggered by global cardiac strain
